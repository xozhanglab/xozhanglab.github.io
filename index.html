            <p>Join our team of motivated researchers at the Xiao-Ou Zhang Lab! We're focused on comprehending noncoding
                sequences,
                gene regulation, and precision medicine for human diseases. Using computational and data-driven methods,
                we develop
                innovative algorithms, statistical tools, and advanced bioinformatics technologies. These tools enable
                us to analyze
                diverse sequencing data types, including second and third-generation sequencing and single-cell
                sequencing, to uncover
                biomedical insights.</p>
            <p>If you're interested in being part of our dynamic research environment, send your CV and research
                interests to <a href="mailto:zhangxiaoou@tongji.edu.cn">
                    zhangxiaoou@tongji.edu.cn</a>. We're welcoming applications for postdocs, graduate students,
                research assistants, and undergraduate research interns. Join us in driving groundbreaking discoveries!

        <h1>Welcome!</h1>
        <p>We are a computational biology group based at the <a target="_blank"
                href="https://life.tongji.edu.cn/">School of Life Sciences and Technology</a>, <a target="_blank"
                href="https://www.tongji.edu.cn/">Tongji University</a>. Our primary focus is to unravel the intricate
            and diverse mechanisms that underlie gene regulation driven by non-coding sequences at the transcriptome
            level. We specialize in the developing of sophisticated methods tailored for the statistical and integrative
            analysis of multi-omics high-throughput data. Through these meticulously crafted investigative approachs, we
            delve into the pivotal role of repetitive sequences, with particular emphasis on transposable elements
            (TEs), in the control of gene expression. In parallel, We strive to unravel the complexity of
            transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene expression regulation, along with elucidating the mechanisms
            governing the biogenesis of non-coding RNAs and their vital biological functions. Our research contributes
            to advancing the understanding of non-coding sequences and their relevance in human health and disease
            therapeutics.</p>
